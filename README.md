Gravity3D
=========
The Attractive 3D Engine


This is my personal sandbox for trying out 3D graphics research. For this reason
it is best suited for smaller projects that does not handle a large number of
world objects as there are no automation for creating and handling objects.
That being said, for creating single objects with complex rendering it should
be purposeful.

The engine supports (or will support) the important bits of OpenGL 4.2 core.

If you want to compile the project on your own you need a few libraries.
You can download my Vendor folder that includes all the 3rd party libraries
used. Or you could check the repository and download everything on your own.
The Gravity3D and Vendor folders should reside in the same folders.
